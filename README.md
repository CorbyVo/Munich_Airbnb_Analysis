## How To Run

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the analysis:

python scripts/run_analysis.py
```

The script creates:

- `results/room_type_summary.csv`
- `results/neighbourhood_summary.csv`
- `images/price_by_room_type.png`
- `images/top_neighbourhoods_by_price.png`
- `images/price_vs_availability.png`

## Project Workflow

1. Load the Munich Airbnb listings dataset.
2. Keep the columns needed for pricing and availability analysis.
3. Clean the price column.
4. Fill missing review frequency values with zero.
5. Remove listings with missing key fields.
6. Filter unrealistic nightly prices above EUR 1,000.
7. Create an availability level feature.
8. Create room-type and neighbourhood summary tables.
9. Save charts and print key findings.

## Limitations

- Prices are listing prices, not final transaction prices.
- Availability does not directly equal occupancy.
- Reviews are only an indirect signal of demand.
- The dataset represents a market snapshot for one collection date.

## Next Steps

- Add calendar data to study seasonality and Oktoberfest pricing.
- Add review data to analyze demand trends over time.
- Build a simple price prediction model after the EDA.
- Create a Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration.
